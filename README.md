# BlackBOX
Image processing sofware specifically for the reduction of BlackGEM and MeerLICHT images

It is based on Kerry Paterson's "BGreduce", but structured differently and directly calls "ZOGY" instead of "subpipe". Written by Paul Vreeswijk with input from Danielle Pieterse, Steven Bloemen and Paul Groot.

It makes grateful use of the following programs that first need to be installed:

- acstools.satdet: https://acstools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/satdet.html
- astroscrappy: https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy
